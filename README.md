# Graduation-Project
This is the Github repository for our graduation project. Firstly, it contains a file on finding interest points/features using SIFT algorithm called "Interest_Point_using_SIFT.py", In addition to another file to match the corresponding points between a pair of images using the SIFT algorithm named "Matching_using_SIFT.py", then we use the corresponding point to find the translation and rotation by fundamental/essential matrix using the 8-point algorithm to pick the correct translation and rotation in a file called "Essential_Matrix.py". Finally, we plot epipolar lines and its code is in a file called "Epipolar_Line.py".  This is a list of project team members' emails to facilitate contacting each of us independently if you wish.  1- Mahmoud El-Sharkawy >> Elsharkawy1299@gmail.com 2- Amr Ewies >> Amrewies1998@gmail.com 3- Zeyad Ghonamy >> Ziad.ghonamy@gmail.com 4- Mokhtar Saeed >> Mokhtarsaeed1999@gmail.com
